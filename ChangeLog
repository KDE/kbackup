- Add Incremental Backup functionality
- Add wildcard filter to ignore files for backup matching a filename pattern

15.5.2010 (0.6.4)

25.09.2009 (0.6.3)
- When running in non interactive mode (e.g. cron), do not use KIO but only direct file access
  as KIO needs a KDE session and $DISPLAY
  This now makes the slice-reduction on the local target dir work.

05.09.2009 (0.6.2)
- Fix handling of disk-full situation (and a crash with it)

01.07.2009 (0.6.1)
- Avoid backup of the backup file
- make it compile with KDE Version < 4.2

24.05.2009 (0.6)
- Port to cmake and KDE4/Qt4, which also removes the 4GB limit per file
- sort hidden files/dirs before normal ones
- show dimmed icon for hidden files (like konqueror)
- don't allow to expand symlinked dirs as the content is not archived but only the link
- Add "Save As..." menu and store name of loaded profile, so that a save directly writes to that
- Add --autobg <profile> commandline which starts kbackup without a GUI e.g. for cron, at, ...
- Add --verbose commandline option which allows to see all files when using --autobg
- When the upload fails for a slice, offer a way to select a temporarily different target
- if target-dir does not exist, create it (mkdir -p)
- # of kept backups on target dir (per profile)
- show list of created archive slices in finish-dialog

19.01.2008 (0.5.4)
- correctly limit slice size:
  - limited by the target directory (when we store directly into a local dir)
  - limited by the "tmp" dir when we create a tmp file for later upload via KIO
  - limited by Qt3 (4GB on 32bit)
  - limited by user defined maxSliceMBs
- sort directories first in treeview
- correctly sort by size and timestamp in treeview
- check if a file that is archived into the backup is not the backup itself
