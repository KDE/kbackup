** KBackup **

A Backup program with an easy to use User Interface
based on the KDE Frameworks version 5.

It uses the cmake build tool.

Simply install it with

cd kbackup-<version>
mkdir kbackup-build
cd kbackup-build
cmake ..
make
make install (as root)

and run it.

It also includes a comprehensive documentation.


Have fun!

P.S.: I welcome feedback
